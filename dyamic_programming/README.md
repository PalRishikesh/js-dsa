### Dynamic Programming (Not a silver buller, (mean not solution for each and every problem :) )
- Solving complex problem, by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems

#### DP
- Solve each sub-problem just one
    1. Store result in table (array, matrix or variable)
    2. Avoid Re-Computation

#### Type of DP
1. Top-Down with Memoization
    - Break problem at the top
    - Recursive -> With table to store result

2. Botton-Up with Tabulation
    - Consider smallest problem first
    - Solutions are typically built iteratively & are stored in a tbale (array)
    - Iterative + table or stored
